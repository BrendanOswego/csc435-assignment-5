<h1>CSC435: Homework 5</h1>
</center>
<hr />
<p>Rebuild your entire project from scratch in the <a href="https://grails.org/">Grails</a> framework. Follow the tutorials to acquire a basic understanding, then reimplement your project at all levels: logic, presentation, data store, and services (both producing and consuming).</p>
<p><b>NB: use gorm</b> for the data layer, as opposed to raw SQL this time.</p>
<p>After this homework your project should be designed well (MVC), complete, and working well on top of Grails.</p>
<p>Submit to the Blackboard dropbox your archived (zip or tar.gz) project directory, following the recommended directory structure.</p>
